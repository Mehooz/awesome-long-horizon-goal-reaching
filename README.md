# ðŸ§¾ Reading List for Topics in learning-based long-horizon goal reaching
By [Minghao Zhang](https://www.minghaozhang.com). Since I only focus on few directions, so it just covers small number of papers in deep learning areas recently (specifically, those papers are related to RL for robot manipulation). If there is anything wrong and missed, just let me know!
